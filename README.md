# LADAL
I have created this repositoy based on the codes availble in LADAL's website [**this page**](https://ladal.edu.au/regression.html). LADAL stands for Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory.
I just made minor changes to the main rmd file while playing with it! [**Dr. Martin Schweinberger**](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/4295/martin-schweinberger) has written the codes and the rmd and I used his work just for learning new things!
